# CI-specific Dockerfile that builds contributoor from source
# This is used for integration testing in GitHub Actions
#
# Why this exists:
# - The main Dockerfile expects a pre-built binary (built by GoReleaser)
# - CI needs to build from source to test the current PR's code changes
# - This ensures we test the actual code being submitted, not a released version
